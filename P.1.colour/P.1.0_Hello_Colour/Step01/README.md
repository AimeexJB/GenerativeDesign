# Hello Colour - Step 1

In this step we set up the canvas using the 2 main functions.

The setup function is where we create the canvas that will be displayed on the screen. It run once when the page is initialized

The Draw function is constantly looping through each line of code that is inside it


```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(500, 500);
}

function draw() {

}
```

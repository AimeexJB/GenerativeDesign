# Assignment 1

The aim of this project was to create a number of experimental colour images using code developed in p5.js and that is also controlled by a number of input parameters. For my project I chose to experiment with colour interpolation on a grid that depends on the distance from the mouse position to the edges of the canvas, Allowing the user to control the interpolation by changing the colour hue with a mouse click.
